MIA is a specially designed strategy for variable selection of SVM. This method statistically identifies the informative variable which by logistics is supposed to reduce the classification risk of SVM. As an example, the paired distributions of SVM margins of an informative gene and an uninformative one based on the colon data is shown below:

(2).Based on model population anlaysis, we recently also developed a new method, called **subwindow permutation analysis(SPA)**,for variable selection in classification. Compared to CARS, SPA has clear **statistical meaning** and can compute a **_conditional p-value_** for each variable which is then used to calculate the **COditional Synergetic Score(COSS)** used for ranking variable. SPA is a very **refreshing** method. The source code of SPA in MATLAB and R can be freely available at:

(3). We developed a very efficient variable selection method, called CARS, which was implemented using PLS and PLS-LDA as basic modeling methods for dealing with regression and classification problems, respectively
